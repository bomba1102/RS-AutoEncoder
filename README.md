# [PyTorch] Recommender system 
## Introduction
This project is evaluate the quality of the AutoEncoder model on [Movielens-1M dataset](https://github.com/windhashira06/RS-AutoEncoder/tree/main/movielens-1m) and suggest to the user which movies they might like.
## Datasets
The Movielens 1M dataset is a popular dataset in the fields of Machine Learning and Data Mining. This dataset consists of 1 million movie ratings rated by 6000 users with over 4000 different movies. This dataset is devided into 2 datasets, that is the train set (750121 ratings) and the test set (250088 ratings).
## Model
 The AutoEncoder model used in this task consists of 1 input layer, 3 hidden layers and 1 output layer. The number of hidden units in each hidden layer are 200, 100 and 200 respectively.

## Training and Evaluation
__1. Training__: The model's input is a utility matrix containing values from 0 to 5, where 0 is the value representing movies that have not been rated by the user and 1 to 5 are user-rated values. The model will learn to represent user-movies as latents vector in the new feature space from which the model will predictions for empty positions (value is 0) in the utility matrix. 
```
for user_nb in range(self.num_users):
    inputs = Variable(train_ds[user_nb]).unsqueeze(0).to(device)
    target = inputs.clone().to(device)
    mask = (target != 0).type(torch.float)*1.
    mask = mask.to(device)
                
    if torch.sum(target.data > 0) > 0:
    outputs = self.model(inputs, self.act_mode)
                    
    target.requires_grad = False
    mask.requires_grad = False

    loss = self.loss(outputs, target, mask)
    loss.backward()
    train_loss += loss.item()
    s += 1
    self.optimizer.step()
```
   The model takes each user-movies vector as input, computes output, compute loss and optimizer                                              
   - Note: We need to multiply the output matrix by a mask matrix to ensure that any positions of the target matrix are 0, those positions of the output matrix are also 0.            

__2. Evaluation__: To evaluate model quality, I use RMSE loss and Top-k Accuracy. Below are the evaluation results:
- RMSE loss:

  | RMSE training loss | RMSE validation loss |
  | :----------------: | :------------------: |
  |       0.88847      |        0.94895       |
- Top-k Accuracy:

  | K = 5 | K = 10 |
  | :----:|:------:|
  | 69.8725| 77.4966|
## Give Recommendations
The model will restore the missing values in the utility matrix, then select k (optional) positions containing the largest values (the larger value, the more user will like that movie) corresponding to k-movies's id that the user will probably like very much.

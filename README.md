# [PyTorch] Recommender system 
## Introduction
This project is evaluate the quality of the AutoEncoder model on [Movielens-1M dataset](https://github.com/windhashira06/RS-AutoEncoder/tree/main/movielens-1m) and suggest to the user which movies they might like.
## Datasets
The Movielens 1M dataset is a popular dataset in the fields of Machine Learning and Data Mining. This dataset consists of 1 million movie ratings rated by 6000 users with over 4000 different movies. This dataset is devided into 2 datasets, that is the train set (750121 ratings) and the test set (250088 ratings).
## Model
The AutoEncoder model 
The AutoEncoder model used in this task consists of 1 input layer, 3 hidden layers and 1 output layer. The number of hidden units in each hidden layer are 200, 100 and 200 respectively.
